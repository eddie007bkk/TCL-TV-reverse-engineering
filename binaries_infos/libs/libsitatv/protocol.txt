The protocol seems to be just the struct in README.md send directly to sitatvservice, but there's a more detailed description of it:

32 bits: client_id
32 bits: entry_id
32 bits: data_lenght
32_bits: request_result
8 bits: extended_parameters
40960 bits max: parameters

* The client_id seems to be almost always 0, and in some cases 1
* The entry_id is one of the enum in the other txt
* The data_lenght is equal to the lenght of data in parameters
* The request_result is always equal to zero
* The extended parameters is 1 if parameters overflows
* The parameters depend of the entry_id

For example, for poweroff: 0x00000000000001c500000001000000000000
