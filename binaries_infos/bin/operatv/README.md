# OperaTV

This is what is started when you have press the "smart tv" button on your remote (or via the menu). it can start "apps" (actually, just web pages), such as youtube (via youtube.com/tv), and show the ipepg (i guess pages served via the ipepg_server on localhost, that uses data from your phone).

It doesn't have much use, actually, beside youtube, it seems to be pretty outdated and not very useful in general, same, i don't want it, i just removed it.
