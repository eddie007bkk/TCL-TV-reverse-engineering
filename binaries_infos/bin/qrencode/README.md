# qrencode

This project is just a qr code generator, and the guy that ported it to the TV actually have the code on github, at https://github.com/skyseraph/qrencode

Nothing to really see here, i'm not even sure it is even used for anything, the only QR code i saw on the TV is actually a pre-generated image, i'll just remove it.
