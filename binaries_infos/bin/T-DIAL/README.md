# T-DIAL (aka dialserver)

This is a [DIAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_and_Launch) server apparently using mongoose (for the http server part). It apparently is the 1st gen chromecast (and netflix uses this also) protocol.

It doesn't seems to du much more than to launch youtube, netflix or OperaTV (maybe only for youtube) with the parameters to launch the  video

There's also a "deadbeef-dead-beef-dead-beefdeadbeef" "uuid"... for some reason, there is only reference to "THOMSON" and not "TCL" (tcl also makes the thomson TVs)

Useless as some others, i'll just remove it.
