# T-DIAL (aka dialserver)

This is a mongoose-based HTTP server that seems to ask sitatvservice to start/stop netflix "youtube" (using OperaTV) and OperaTV itself. my guess is that it handles the UPNP remote control with some "bonuses"

There's also a "deadbeef-dead-beef-dead-beefdeadbeef" "uuid"... for some reason, there is only reference to "THOMSON" and not "TCL" (tcl also makes the thomson TVs)

Useless as some others, i'll just remove it.
