# mediaserver

It seems to be the UPNP/DLNA or just a media playing service, i guess, but the binary is so small, i dont' know (nor did i spent time on it) what is exact use is. it seems custom to TCL as it have tcl functions called in the binary. there's also lots of binaries from FOSS project in the bin/ folder, such as gstreamer and gnutls, among others, there's also a python2.7 folder in lib/ even though there's absolutely no python whatsoever in this TV, wtf?
