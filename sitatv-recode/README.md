# Sitatvservice recode

This is an attempt to recode the sitatvservice binary so i can understand a little bit more how it works...
# WARNING: even if it's C code it isn't intented to compile (yet?), as it's missing lots of functions and includes!

## Dir meanings

* src/ trying to re-code some parts of sitatvservice
* src-tcl/ trying to get the original tree of source files from tcl
* random/ some random tests to make binaries that works
